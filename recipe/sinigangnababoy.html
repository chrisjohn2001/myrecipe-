                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>Sinigang is a Filipino soup cooked with pork. Serve with rice and for additional sauce, use soy or fish sauce. <br>
                    If you want to, you can add what Filipinos call gabi gabi, which is a small taro root. When peeled they look like potatoes. <br>
                     You can add five to six of them when you add the water and make sure they are cooked through. Take them out when they are cooked <br>
                      because they can get too soft.</p>
